# Academic Pages
**Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites.**

# Getting Started

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Click the "Use this template" button in the top right.
1. On the "New repository" page, enter your repository name as "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and add your content.
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the `files/` directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
1. (Optional) Use the Jupyter notebooks or python scripts in the `markdown_generator` folder to generate markdown files for publications and talks from a TSV file.

## Running locally

When you are initially working your website, it is very useful to be able to preview the changes locally before pushing them to GitHub. To work locally you will need to:

1. Clone the repository and made updates as detailed above.
1. Make sure you have ruby-dev, bundler, and nodejs installed
    
    On most Linux distribution and [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) the command is:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler nodejs
    ```
    On MacOS the commands are:
    ```bash
    brew install ruby
    brew install node
    gem install bundler
    ```
1. Run `bundle install` to install ruby dependencies. If you get errors, delete Gemfile.lock and try again.
1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.

If you are running on Linux it may be necessary to install some additional dependencies prior to being able to run locally: `sudo apt install build-essential gcc make`

## Using Docker

Working from a different OS, or just want to avoid installing dependencies? You can use the provided `Dockerfile` to build a container that will run the site for you if you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Start by build the container:

```bash
docker build -t jekyll-site .
```

Next, run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 4000:4000 --rm -v $(pwd):/usr/src/app jekyll-site
```

# Maintenance

Bug reports and feature requests to the template should be [submitted via GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/issues/new/choose). For questions concerning how to style the template, please feel free to start a [new discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions).

This repository was forked (then detached) by [Stuart Geiger](https://github.com/staeiou) from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), which is Â© 2016 Michael Rose and released under the MIT License (see LICENSE.md). It is currently being maintained by [Robert Zupko](https://github.com/rjzupkoii) and additional maintainers would be welcomed.

## Bugfixes and enhancements

If you have bugfixes and enhancements that you would like to submit as a pull request, you will need to [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository as opposed to using it as a template. This will also allow you to [synchronize your copy](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) of template to your fork as well.

Unfortunately, one logistical issue with a template theme like Academic Pages that makes it a little tricky to get bug fixes and updates to the core theme. If you use this template and customize it, you will probably get merge conflicts if you attempt to synchronize. If you want to save your various .yml configuration files and markdown files, you can delete the repository and fork it again. Or you can manually patch.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).

# Getting started

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right.
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

## Site-wide configuration

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [\_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [\_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.

## Create content & metadata

For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like \_publications, \_talks, \_posts, \_teaching, or \_pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [\_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the \_talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

## How to edit your site's GitHub repository

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
