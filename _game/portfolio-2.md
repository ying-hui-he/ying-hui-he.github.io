title: "SpaceShift: The Size Puzzle"
excerpt: "This is my first original game. The key mechanism is that the player can be shifted to three different sizes, making different interactions with the environment.
Players need to keep changing the size to navigate through the tunnels, air currents and breakable platforms and solve the platform puzzles.<br/><img src='/images/spaceshift.png'>"
