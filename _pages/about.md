Hi there! I'm Yinghui He, a first-year PhD student at Princeton University Computer Science Department. I work with [Sanjeev Arora](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~arora/) at [Princeton Language and Intelligence](https://pli.princeton.edu/) (PLI). I'm broadly interested in Natural Language Processing, especially the two-way relation between artificial intelligence and human cognition. Prior to that, I finished my B.S.E in Computer Science at the University of Michigan, where I had the honor to work with [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and [Wei Hu](https://weihu.me/). I've also got a B.E. in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
